# ML_findingDonors

This is my second project in IEEE CIS the project made us use 3 different models of our choice to get the best accuracy in classifing the income of people to >50k or <=50k , i used logistic regression , svm and randomforest they were all of very close accuracies yet randomforest was the fatsest to i stick to it.
